# 🚀 TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning

![TTRL Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Welcome to the **TTRL** repository! This project focuses on Test-Time Reinforcement Learning, a method that allows agents to adapt and improve their performance during testing phases. 

## 📦 Overview

Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) enhances the ability of machine learning models to learn from their environment in real-time. By employing strategies that adapt to new situations during testing, TTRL aims to create more robust and efficient models. This approach is particularly useful in dynamic environments where conditions can change rapidly.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Real-Time Adaptation**: TTRL enables agents to learn and adjust during testing.
- **Dynamic Learning**: It adapts to new data and environments.
- **Scalable Framework**: Easily integrates with existing reinforcement learning frameworks.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guidelines for implementation and usage.

## 📚 Installation

To get started with TTRL, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohagowda/TTRL.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TTRL
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📈 Usage

To use TTRL in your projects, follow the instructions below. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up.

### Basic Example

Here’s a simple example of how to implement TTRL:

```python
import ttrl

# Initialize your environment
env = ttrl.create_environment()

# Create your agent
agent = ttrl.Agent()

# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for TTRL.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **OpenAI Gym**: For environment simulations.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For model training.

## 📊 Examples

Here are some examples showcasing TTRL in action:

### Example 1: Simple Navigation

This example demonstrates how TTRL can be applied to a navigation task where an agent learns to find its way through a maze.

```python
# Navigation environment setup
env = ttrl.create_navigation_environment()

# Initialize the agent
agent = ttrl.Agent()

# Training loop
for episode in range(500):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state
```

### Example 2: Dynamic Environment

In this example, the agent learns to adapt to changes in the environment, showcasing the real-time learning capabilities of TTRL.

```python
# Dynamic environment setup
env = ttrl.create_dynamic_environment()

# Initialize the agent
agent = ttrl.Agent()

# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state
        env.update()  # Update the environment dynamically
```
